## HelloAndroid 

This is my first projectof the course Android app development challenge.  

First, I created my own design for Udacityâ€™s card. The main image has different elements, that from my point of view, represents what Udacity could offer us.

Then, I followed the instructions trying to incorporate all the tips from the previous exercises.
Among the new things I tried, I decided to include the android:drawableLeft instead of having two elements (Icon + Text).
Also,  in the landscape view, I added a Scrollview. I am not sure if it is the best (esthetics), but I wanted to try it as an exercise.
